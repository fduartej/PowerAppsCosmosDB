# PowerAppsCosmosDB
This is a lab to walk users through how to create a PowerApp to read from Azure Cosmos DB via Flow.

This tutoral is based on the assumption that you already have an MX Chip connected to an IoT Hub and Stream Anlytics is processing the messages and writing this information to a SQL API based Cosmos DB.  We will then use Microsoft Flow to process and structure that no SQL data stored in the Cosmos DB json documents and pass it to Power Apps in a strutured manner so it can process and render the data in the Power Apps GUI.
